1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,839
Imagine yourself in the finance department at Parch & Posey.

2
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:06,029
You want to look up the most recent orders,

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:10,429
so that you can confirm that invoices have been sent to those customers.

4
00:00:10,429 --> 00:00:12,855
The Order By clause will help you accomplish this,

5
00:00:12,855 --> 00:00:16,440
by allowing you to sort the orders by date.

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,275
Let's first take a look at how the data is ordered by default.

7
00:00:20,274 --> 00:00:24,379
You'll notice that this table appears to be sorted by Account ID by default.

8
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:28,339
It starts at 1001, and goes up from there.

9
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:30,414
Let's add an Order By clause to

10
00:00:30,414 --> 00:00:33,195
reorder the results based on the date the order was placed,

11
00:00:33,195 --> 00:00:36,299
which you can see in the occurred_at column.

12
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:40,734
Notice that the order by clause goes between the From and Limit clauses.

13
00:00:40,734 --> 00:00:42,585
You have to write the clauses in this order,

14
00:00:42,585 --> 00:00:44,520
or the query will not run.

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,120
By default, order by goes from a to z,

16
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:51,089
lowest to highest, or earliest to latest,

17
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,050
if working with dates.

18
00:00:53,049 --> 00:00:55,674
This is referred to as ascending order.

19
00:00:55,674 --> 00:00:58,179
You'll notice that that's what's happening here.

20
00:00:58,179 --> 00:00:59,865
If you want to order the other way,

21
00:00:59,865 --> 00:01:02,054
you can add DESC,

22
00:01:02,054 --> 00:01:06,280
short for descending, to the end of the Order By clause.

23
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,400
This will get us to the data set that we're after,

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,620
which shows the 10 most recent orders,

25
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,240
with the most recent at the top.
