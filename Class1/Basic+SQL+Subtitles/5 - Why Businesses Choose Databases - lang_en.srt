00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,589
Nearly all applications have a need to store data so that it can be accessed later.

2
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:06,790
Let's use Twitter as an example.

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:08,445
Every time I write a tweet,

4
00:00:08,445 --> 00:00:13,740
the text of my tweet needs to be stored somewhere so that all my followers can read it.

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,155
Twitter stores a bunch of information about my tweet.

6
00:00:16,155 --> 00:00:17,589
Who the author is?

7
00:00:17,589 --> 00:00:19,469
Me. The time I wrote it,

8
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:24,379
links to any other relevant tweets if I'm writing a reply or a re-tweet, etcetera.

9
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:29,814
All this information is used to determine who sees my tweet and when they see it.

10
00:00:29,815 --> 00:00:31,920
This is the function databases serve.

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,093
They store information so that it can be accessed later,

12
00:00:35,093 --> 00:00:40,090
and SQL is the language that allows analysts and others to access that information.

13
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:43,330
Databases have a number of attributes that make them great for this.

14
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:47,489
Most importantly, databases do a lot to check for data integrity.

15
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,245
They can make sure that the data entered is consistent.

16
00:00:50,244 --> 00:00:53,759
For example, if you're storing the number of children a given person has,

17
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:56,739
the database can enforce that only whole numbers be used,

18
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,545
since you can't have half a child.

19
00:00:58,545 --> 00:01:00,899
Databases are also really fast,

20
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,054
they can perform operations very quickly across

21
00:01:03,054 --> 00:01:06,349
very large data sets and can be optimized for extra speed.

22
00:01:06,349 --> 00:01:08,304
Databases are shared entities.

23
00:01:08,305 --> 00:01:11,210
Many people can access a database concurrently.

24
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:14,534
More importantly, all of those people will be working with the same data.

25
00:01:14,534 --> 00:01:19,109
To facilitate this, databases have lots of administrative features like access controls.
