1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,984
Imagine you're a sales manager at Parch and Posey.

2
00:00:02,984 --> 00:00:06,665
You're considering promoting two of your top sales reps into management,

3
00:00:06,665 --> 00:00:09,269
but you need to figure out how you're going to divvy up all of

4
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:12,640
their accounts among the other sales reps. To do this,

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,760
let's first take a look at all of Parch and Posey's accounts.

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,675
You can see here that there are 351 in total.

7
00:00:19,675 --> 00:00:25,335
Now let's look at the accounts that these two high performing sales reps are working.

8
00:00:25,335 --> 00:00:29,490
You can see here we filtered the list of accounts to just the two reps in question,

9
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:31,504
nine accounts in total.

10
00:00:31,504 --> 00:00:33,844
In deciding who to assign these accounts to,

11
00:00:33,844 --> 00:00:35,399
you might also want to consider which

12
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,265
accounts the other sales reps are currently working.

13
00:00:38,265 --> 00:00:40,530
In other words, you'd like to look at all the accounts that

14
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,285
are not listed in this query we're looking at right now.

15
00:00:43,284 --> 00:00:46,034
The NOT operator will allow you to do exactly this.

16
00:00:46,034 --> 00:00:48,869
By simply typing NOT before this logical statement,

17
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:50,864
I can turn it into the inverse.

18
00:00:50,865 --> 00:00:52,605
You can see that in this new result set,

19
00:00:52,604 --> 00:00:55,244
none of the accounts that were previously shown are appearing.

20
00:00:55,244 --> 00:00:58,304
Of the 351 accounts that Parch and Posey sells to,

21
00:00:58,304 --> 00:01:01,435
the nine in the previous query are absent from this result set,

22
00:01:01,435 --> 00:01:03,795
so we see 342 results.

23
00:01:03,795 --> 00:01:05,370
NOT also works with LIKE,

24
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,344
the same way it works with IN.

25
00:01:07,344 --> 00:01:11,609
You can see here, we're looking at web traffic from Google in order to illustrate this.

26
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:14,400
By adding NOT, we can look at the inverse,

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,000
all traffic from sites other than Google.
