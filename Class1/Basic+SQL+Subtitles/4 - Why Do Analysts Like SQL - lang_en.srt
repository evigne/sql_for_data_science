00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,353
A lot of the world's data lives in databases,

2
00:00:03,353 --> 00:00:07,859
and most of the world's databases are accessed using structured query language,

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:12,605
which is typically abbreviated as as SQL, or SQL.

4
00:00:12,605 --> 00:00:14,705
It's been around since the 1970s,

5
00:00:14,705 --> 00:00:19,074
and is the most common method of accessing data and databases today.

6
00:00:19,074 --> 00:00:22,429
SQL has a variety of functions that allow its users to read,

7
00:00:22,429 --> 00:00:25,035
manipulate, and change data.

8
00:00:25,035 --> 00:00:28,718
It's also popular for data analysis for a few reasons.

9
00:00:28,718 --> 00:00:32,335
First, it's semantically easy to understand and learn.

10
00:00:32,335 --> 00:00:36,230
It can be used to access large amounts of data directly where it's stored.

11
00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:39,214
You don't have to copy data into other applications to view it,

12
00:00:39,215 --> 00:00:41,000
and you don't need to worry about your spreadsheet

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,435
program crashing because of data overload.

14
00:00:43,435 --> 00:00:45,375
It's easy to audit and replicate.

15
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:47,634
In a spreadsheet tool like Excel,

16
00:00:47,634 --> 00:00:51,385
you have to click in to each cell to know how they're calculated.

17
00:00:51,386 --> 00:00:56,265
With SQL, you can just read a query from top to bottom, nothing's hidden.

18
00:00:56,265 --> 00:01:02,105
Finally, SQL can run queries on multiple tables at once, across large datasets.

19
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:05,319
It's great for performing the types of aggregations you might

20
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:08,184
normally do in an Excel pivot table, sums,

21
00:01:08,185 --> 00:01:10,269
counts, minimums and maximums,

22
00:01:10,269 --> 00:01:14,844
etcetera, but Excel maxes out at just over 1 million rows.

23
00:01:14,844 --> 00:01:18,429
With SQL, you can query across billions of rows at a time.

24
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:21,910
Maybe most importantly, SQL's incredibly flexible,

25
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:27,340
especially when compared to out of the box dashboard products like Google Analytics.

26
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:30,370
In Google Analytics, you might be able to answer questions like,

27
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,740
which pages on my site receive the most traffic?

28
00:01:32,739 --> 00:01:34,659
And where does it come from?

29
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:38,825
But you can use SQL's filtering capabilities to answer much deeper,

30
00:01:38,825 --> 00:01:40,820
more complex questions like,

31
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:45,274
how many viewers return to my site between one and three weeks after their first visit?

32
00:01:45,275 --> 00:01:47,600
And what typically brings them back?

33
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:48,890
These features make SQL one of

34
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:52,560
the primary data analysis tools for both beginners and experts.
