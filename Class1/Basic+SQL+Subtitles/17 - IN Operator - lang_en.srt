1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,835
Imagine you're a sales manager at Parch and Posey,

2
00:00:02,835 --> 00:00:05,474
and you want to see how several key accounts are performing.

3
00:00:05,474 --> 00:00:10,039
The IN function will allow you to filter data based on several possible values.

4
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:11,939
So, if you only want to see information for

5
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:15,250
the Walmart and Apple accounts, here's how you do it.

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,184
As with comparison operators,

7
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:19,289
IN requires single quotation marks around

8
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:22,849
non-numerical data while numerical data can be entered directly.

9
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:26,095
Let's look at the actual orders associated with those accounts.

10
00:00:26,094 --> 00:00:28,354
First, make note of the account IDs here,

11
00:00:28,355 --> 00:00:33,509
1001 for Walmart and 1021 for Apple.

12
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:37,945
Now we see all of the individual orders that come up for accounts 1001 and 1021,

13
00:00:37,945 --> 00:00:39,600
and as you can see, they're all jumbled together

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,300
because there is no ORDER BY clause in the query.

15
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:45,399
One thing to note here is the comma between these two values.

16
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:48,179
You can put as many values as you want inside these parentheses,

17
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:51,090
but you have to put a comma in between each pair of distinct values.
