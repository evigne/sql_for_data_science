1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,209
Before we calculate how much non-standard paper was sold,

2
00:00:03,209 --> 00:00:07,705
let's check out the order quantities in each column of the orders table.

3
00:00:07,705 --> 00:00:10,169
Now let's create a new column that adds poster and gloss

4
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:13,800
paper together to create a field for nonstandard paper.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:19,859
To do this, we'll create a new line in the query and use an arithmetic operator.

6
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:22,754
You'll notice that the values in this new column are equal to the sum

7
00:00:22,754 --> 00:00:26,174
of the gloss and poster quantities on a row-by-row basis.

8
00:00:26,175 --> 00:00:29,190
In the first row, 22 gloss and 24

9
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:33,550
poster sum to 46 nonstandard in this new column we've created.

10
00:00:33,549 --> 00:00:35,604
There's a special name for this.

11
00:00:35,604 --> 00:00:37,154
It's a derived column.

12
00:00:37,155 --> 00:00:42,375
Derived columns can include simple arithmetic or any number of advanced calculations.

13
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,340
What makes them special is the fact that they're not

14
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,665
just directly selected from the underlying data,

15
00:00:46,664 --> 00:00:48,359
they're manipulated in some way.

16
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:50,670
Rather than stick with this ugly column name,

17
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,380
let's add something more descriptive using an alias.

18
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,800
We can do this by adding AS to the end of the line that

19
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:59,204
produces the derived column and then giving it a name.

20
00:00:59,204 --> 00:01:02,519
The best practice here is to use names that are clearly descriptive,

21
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,998
follow existing conventions, and don't include capital letters or spaces.

22
00:01:06,998 --> 00:01:09,000
We'll use non-standard quantity.
