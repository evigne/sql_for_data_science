1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:04,820
Let's say, you want to order results by account,

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:06,160
and within each account,

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,599
have orders sorted from largest to smallest,

4
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:13,759
so you'll be able to quickly see what the largest orders were for each account.

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,269
You can use an ORDER BY over multiple columns to achieve this,

6
00:00:17,269 --> 00:00:21,289
and the sorting will happen in the order that you specify the columns.

7
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:30,107
So, let's start by ordering by the account_id, and then, total_amt_usd,

8
00:00:30,108 --> 00:00:32,755
which we'll make DESCENDING,

9
00:00:32,755 --> 00:00:40,850
so the largest values will be first.

10
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:46,550
So I run this, you can see that the first account we get is 1001,

11
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:53,754
and then the orders descend from 9426 all the way down.

12
00:00:53,755 --> 00:01:01,765
And then after that, we have 1021 and that account's largest orders and so forth.

13
00:01:01,765 --> 00:01:04,790
Now what happens, if I flip this,

14
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:15,290
so the amount will be first, and then we sort by account.

15
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,900
What's happening here is that we're starting with

16
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:31,430
the highest amount and sorting descending.

17
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:42,140
So, this is the largest order of all time at $232207 and that went to account 4251.

18
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,165
Now, It doesn't seem to be sorting by account id.

19
00:01:45,165 --> 00:01:49,060
The reason for that is that,

20
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:56,515
all of these amounts are so precise that there aren't multiple rows of the same amount.

21
00:01:56,515 --> 00:01:59,977
So, if there were two rows in the set with the exact same amount,

22
00:01:59,977 --> 00:02:07,009
you might notice that account ID within that is sorted from smallest to largest.

23
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:11,120
But, since we're just sorting by the total amount column,

24
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,909
then we don't see that here.
