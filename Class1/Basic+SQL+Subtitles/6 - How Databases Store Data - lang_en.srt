00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,640
If you've used Excel, you should already be familiar with tables,

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,565
they're similar to spreadsheets.

3
00:00:05,565 --> 00:00:08,804
Tables have rows and columns just like Excel,

4
00:00:08,804 --> 00:00:10,844
but have some more rigid rules.

5
00:00:10,845 --> 00:00:13,120
Database tables for instance,

6
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:14,669
are organized by column,

7
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:17,399
and each column must have a unique name.

8
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:20,504
You'll notice that some columns contain numbers,

9
00:00:20,504 --> 00:00:22,754
while others contain text.

10
00:00:22,754 --> 00:00:25,875
In a spreadsheet, each cell can have its own data type.

11
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:27,390
But in database tables,

12
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,899
all the data in a column must be of the same type.

13
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:34,414
This makes performing analysis on database tables pretty simple.

14
00:00:34,414 --> 00:00:36,329
While the data type must be consistent,

15
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:39,939
the database doesn't necessarily know that a number means latitude,

16
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:42,519
or that the text is a name of a company.

17
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,820
That's why descriptive column names are important.
